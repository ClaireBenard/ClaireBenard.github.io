## Bio

I'm a data scientist, keen to use data to solve problems that matter. My earlier work experience was in national and international charities and although I'm now a consultant, I still volunteer for [DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/).  


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F, fig.height=2, fig.width=6}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

data <- data.frame(
  name=c("Data strategy", "Machine Learning", "Statistics", "Business Intelligence"),
  score= c(5, 4, 4, 3)
)

p <- data %>%
  arrange(score) %>%    # First sort by val. This sort the dataframe but NOT the factor levels
  mutate(name=factor(name, levels=name)) %>%   # This trick update the factor levels
  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=score)) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend=name, yend=0), colour = "orange", size = 2) +
    geom_point( size=3, color="orange") +
    coord_flip() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = NULL,
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)


ggplotly(p, tooltip = "score")

```
