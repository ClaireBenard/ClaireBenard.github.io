## Bio

I'm a data scientist, keen to use data to solve problems that matter. My earlier work experience was in national and international charities and although I'm now a consultant, I still volunteer for [DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/).  


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F, fig.height=2, fig.width=6}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

data <- data.frame(
  name=c("Data strategy", "Machine Learning", "Statistics", "Business Intelligence"),
  score= c(5, 4, 4, 3)
)

p <- data %>%
  arrange(score) %>%    # First sort by val. This sort the dataframe but NOT the factor levels
  mutate(name=factor(name, levels=name)) %>%   # This trick update the factor levels
  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=score)) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend=name, yend=0), colour = "orange", size = 2) +
    geom_point( size=3, color="orange") +
    coord_flip() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(title = NULL,
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)


ggplotly(p, tooltip = "score")

```

## Projects

**Charity classifier**  
_When registering with the Commission, charities must declare their sector of activity. This is a tick box with 16 options. Due to the nature of the sector, most organisations tick at least 2, and some as many as all 16 boxes._
_This attempts to classify organisations based on their charitable object, their legal definition of their activity. Given the wording of their object, the model returns the most likely sector of activity._
